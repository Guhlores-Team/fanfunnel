-- 0034 Atomic bulk fan import (multi-review follow-up: fans/import was rated
-- CRITICAL for non-atomicity). The route inserted fans -> fan_passes -> grants as
-- three separate statements with best-effort app-level rollback, so a crash or a
-- failed compensation between steps could orphan rows. This SECURITY DEFINER
-- function performs all three inserts in one function body — a single implicit
-- transaction — so any failure rolls the whole batch back automatically.
--
-- The route still validates + resolves each row (wheel resolution, caps,
-- blank-name/invalid filtering) and supplies client-generated UUIDs so the three
-- tables stay correlated by explicit id. This function forces
-- creator_id = auth.uid() and re-verifies wheel/campaign ownership, because
-- SECURITY DEFINER bypasses RLS.
--
-- p_rows: jsonb array of objects
--   { fan_id, pass_id, token, wheel_id, campaign_id|null, name, spins, amount_cents }
