-- Phase 7.1 — fixes
-- #2 Multiple wheels showing "Active": wheels.is_active defaulted to TRUE, so
-- every newly-created/saved wheel was born active. Flip the default to FALSE
-- and repair existing data so exactly ONE wheel per creator is active.

alter table public.wheels alter column is_active set default false;

-- Repair: for each creator, keep the most-recently-updated active wheel active
-- and deactivate the rest. If a creator has NO active wheel after that, promote
-- their oldest non-archived wheel.

-- Lock down the (now unused) prize-photos bucket so it can't serve content, and

-- (nullable, never written by the app) to avoid a destructive migration.
